In contrast, an ambiguous question lacks clear reference or detailed semantics, making it difficult for the model to pinpoint exact regions or objects. The paper addresses this by proposing high-resolution dense alignment and multi-granularity visual encoding to better handle detailed and precise referring, thus improving performance on well-defined but challenging questions.

The ablation studies (Table 5) show that accommodating any resolution input enhances the model’s ability to accurately localize and classify objects, recognize text, and perform reasoning, thereby supporting more reliable and fine-grained visual understanding essential for safety-critical scenarios.

This leads to more precise and accurate referring and grounding performance, as demonstrated by substantial gains on datasets like LVIS and SA, which involve detailed visual understanding. The improved precision in identifying small or complex regions supports reliable spatial reasoning, which is crucial in safety-critical scenarios. Additionally, the mutual benefits observed between grounding and referring tasks suggest robustness in interpreting visual inputs flexibly.

Ferret-v2 achieves the highest accuracy on free-form referring tasks on both LVIS and SA-refer datasets, demonstrating its superior capability to interpret and localize objects referred to by free-form shapes compared to multiple-choice or more constrained referring formats.

Unlike some models (e.g., Kosmos-2, GPT4-ROI, CogVLM-17B) that do not support free-form referring, Ferret-v2 comprehensively supports free-form shape referring and achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on free-form referring tasks across datasets like LVIS and SA-refer. This indicates that CARA’s approach effectively manages free-form spatial references beyond multiple-choice or fixed bounding box formats, enabling precise and flexible referring object classification.",,"CARA (as embodied in the Ferret and Ferret-v2 models) handles free-form answers by using a hybrid region representation that combines discrete coordinate tokens and continuous region features to refer to any region in the image, including free-form shapes. Unlike many other models that only support point or box referring, Ferret-v2 supports free-form referring comprehensively, as shown by its superior accuracy on free-form shape referring tasks in both LVIS and SA-refer datasets.

Specifically, Ferret-v2 represents free-form shapes with normalized coordinates and continuous features extracted by a spatial-aware visual sampler, enabling it to interpret and localize objects referred to by free-form spatial references effectively. This capability is absent in several other models like Kosmos-2, GPT4-ROI, and CogVLM-17B, which do not support free-form referring.

Thus, compared to multiple-choice or fixed-format referring (point or box), CARA (Ferret-v2) handles free-form answers by integrating detailed spatial and semantic information through its multi-granularity visual encoding and hybrid region representation, resulting in significantly better performance on free-form referring tasks.",,"CARA (as embodied by Ferret and Ferret-v2) handles free-form answers by representing referred regions through a hybrid region representation combining discrete coordinates and continuous region features, allowing the model to interpret and generate responses about any region shape (point, box, or free-form).

Ferret-v2, in particular, improves this capability through multi-granularity visual encoding and a three-stage training paradigm, which enhances its ability to handle free-form shapes with higher resolution and finer detail, outperforming prior models that often lack free-form referring support.

Initially, in Stage I (Image-Caption Alignment), the model aligns low-resolution global image features with captions, freezing the image encoder and LLM, and training only a projector. This stage does not involve referring or the visual sampler.

Stage II (High-resolution Dense Alignment) introduces fine-grained spatial understanding by aligning local image patches with detailed semantics through dense referring and detection tasks. Here, the model learns to classify and localize multiple objects in high-resolution images, bridging the gap between coarse global semantics and precise local details. The visual sampler and projectors for both global (CLIP) and local (DINOv2) encoders are trained, while encoders and LLM remain frozen.

Finally, Stage III (Intent-Enhanced Instruction Tuning) fine-tunes the entire model, including encoders and LLM, to better interpret user instructions with high-resolution perception.

This staged training strategy relates to deferred prediction or “ask a human” strategies by progressively refining the model’s understanding from coarse to fine details, enabling it to handle complex referring and grounding tasks that require precise spatial reasoning. The dense alignment stage effectively acts as an intermediate step to resolve ambiguities and improve detailed perception before final instruction tuning, analogous to deferring complex decisions until sufficient detailed information is integrated.",

This approach, as implemented in Ferret-v2, dynamically selects optimal image resolutions to preserve aspect ratios and minimize wasted pixels, encoding image patches separately before passing them to the language model. This flexible resolution handling leads to better performance on referring tasks (e.g., ROC on LVIS) compared to direct upsampling or fixed-resolution methods.
